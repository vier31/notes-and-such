### an eternal beginner

I am of the age where, if I'd started earlier, I would be of the old guard. But I didn't and so, I am new to many things. Blogging being one of them.

I have waited a long time for many things. Now, as kitchy as it sounds, I got up.

And now, it is really hard, because I am not young any more. I have responsibilities. Fixed costs and all that fun stuff that living in a capitalistic society brings you.

No degree, no nothing. Just a pile of experiences. some artifacts from lives lived and big bag of dreams.

You, dear reader, no nothing of this. Of course. You don't know me. And so, I am left rambling into the void. Is there even anyone out there?

This is a fever dream. And no, this is not deep and I am not 14 anymore. Quite the opposite.

But I have to start somewhere. Opening the valve slowly. After all these years. Lots of thoughts and pressure to let it all out. The artist life. That could have been. Should have? I am not sure. It is healthier this way. And it needs to get out nonetheless.

So I am opening the valve. Here is the output. Boah.

Now you're probably thinking, why am I even reading this? How did I get here? What is this train wreck of a sorry existence? And you're probably right. You came to the small and humble corner of an otherwise insignificant existence on this planet.

No sugar coating this one. Just as insignificant as anyone else. so I might just as well document my experience. Because, if not me, who will?

And the kids might have questions later.
