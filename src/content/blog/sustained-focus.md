One thing I'm struggling with is sticking to a decision I made. It feels scary to commit to one thing to do with my life.

So, besides not commiting to my adult life responsebilities, I am not commiting to this artist life I am dreaming about. And just like the clich√©, my life is passing me without anything being done.

This is why I am compiling a **Won't Do List** in the hopes of being able to get to an identity by discarding options.
